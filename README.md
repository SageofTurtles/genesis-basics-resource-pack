# Description

This resource pack was designed to supplement the Create: Genesis modpack by improving inter-mod compatibility.  This resource pack is configured to be required for that modpack, and is enabled by default.  Genesis: Basics includes only the bare-bones modifications necessary, making it minimalistic and highly compatible with players' other preferred resource packs.

**Please note that this is NOT a stand-alone resource pack and does very little without the Create: Genesis modpack (coming soon)!**
